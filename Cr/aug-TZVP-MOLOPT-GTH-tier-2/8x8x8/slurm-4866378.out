slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 4866378 ON i05r10c01s02 CANCELLED AT 2025-08-08T17:53:29 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[19357,0],0] on node i05r10c01s02
  Remote daemon: [[19357,0],3] on node i05r10c01s05

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
