ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[51039,0],0] on node i06r05c06s02
  Remote daemon: [[51039,0],2] on node i06r05c06s04

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
