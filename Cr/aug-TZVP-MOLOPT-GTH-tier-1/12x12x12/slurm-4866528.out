slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 4866528 ON i01r10c02s08 CANCELLED AT 2025-08-08T18:16:07 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[59254,0],0] on node i01r10c02s08
  Remote daemon: [[59254,0],3] on node i01r10c02s11

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
