INFO: For the correct use of python with EAR, it is necessary to export the following environment variable:

ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[5285,0],0] on node i03r04c02s06
  Remote daemon: [[5285,0],2] on node i03r04c02s08

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
