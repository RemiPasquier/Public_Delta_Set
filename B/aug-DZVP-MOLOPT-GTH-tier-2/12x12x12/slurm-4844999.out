slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 4844999 ON i04r08c01s06 CANCELLED AT 2025-08-05T05:02:30 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[40761,0],0] on node i04r08c01s06
  Remote daemon: [[40761,0],1] on node i04r08c01s07

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
